Sorting Algorigthm and Big O notation in C programming.

This Repository contains varous algorithms using a linked list and array.
It contains various calculations of Big O notation in determining the
best algorithm with regards to time complexity.


Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
